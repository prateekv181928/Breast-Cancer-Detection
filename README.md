# Breast-Cancer-Detection - POC
With extracted features from MRI's training different models and comparing their performances to detect breast cancer.

Tech Stack – Python 3.6, SciKitLearn and Plotly Chart Studio

Role:
• Created correlation-matrix to identify and eliminate redundant and highly correlated
features.
• Categorical variable encoding.
• Normalized the numerical feature variables.
• Performed PCA to analyze feature variance.
• Trained different models on the normalized dataset and top 10 principal components.
• Compared model performances using confusion matrix and model accuracy.
• Prepared analysis summary document.
